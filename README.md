# ThesisAnalysis
Statistical analysis of Study II from the PhD Thesis titled: "Navigating urban-wildlife conflicts: ecological dynamics and management of synurbic wild boar", by María Escobar González.

This repository contains the full R-based statistical workflow for the Study II of my PhD thesis on urban wild boar ecology and management, including time series decomposition, generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs), and multivariate modelling.

This repository has been prepared for peer review as part of the doctoral thesis evaluation process. All scripts are designed for transparency and reproducibility.

The full analysis is broken into three R Markdown and HTML documents. You can explore each as an interactive HTML report:

Preprocessing steps (e.g., linear interpolation) are described in each R Markdown file.

If full datasets cannot be shared due to privacy or ethical considerations, sample or simulated data may be provided for reproducibility purposes.
